fixes:
*deleted <style> tags in all of the html files completely.
*add the the <meta view port> tag to make the websites mobile friendly
*transformed every <div class="container"> to <section> tag
*transformed every <div class="footer"> to <footer>
*transformed every <div class="header"> to <header>
*I wasn't sure where to put my article tags in the html file but I inserted it in the .aboutmepara class previously
*added a <nav> tag, inside of it an h3 tag under the logo as a visible link to the index
*added the .recipesgrid container on every html for ease of access to every html link
*incremented  the images folder inside the css folder to avoid the img in the .aboutmepic to disappear
*made the css file easier to debug by importing css files, thanks to my reviewer for the handful insight.
*the css files are now divided to 3 sections.  index-style.css <--- rep.css <-- maintenance-style.css
